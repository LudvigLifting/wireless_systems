1.    The code can be constructed as a systematic code, what does this mean?
        With systematic code, the input data is included in the codeword.
2.    That the code is linear is an important fact that simplifies the implementation drastically.
    a)  What does it mean that a code is linear?
        If a code is linear, it means that the transformation from input to codeword is a linear transformation.
    b)  What is it that becomes easier?
        You can use Linear algebra and use matrices for the code conversions.
3.    How many errors can the Hamming(7,4) code detect and correct?
        It can detect and correct 1 error.
4.    What is the generator matrix G?
        The Generator matrix is used to transform the input into the codeword.
5.    What is the parity check matrix H?
        The parity check matrix is used for checking the parity bits and if they hold, it can be used to create the syndrome vector.
6.    What is the syndrome vector s?
        The syndrome vector is a vector representing the placement of an error, if it is the null vector then there are no errors.
