Block interleaver theory questions:
1. The purpouse is to distribute burst errors over the whole sequence, so that no whole codeword is lost.
2. Because there will still be the same amount of errors, only distributed over the whole sequence.
3. The latency of the interleaver in fig 14.26 is N*D*Tb where N is the word length, D is the separation distance and Tb is the bit duration.
4. They are separated by the distance D (or by the number of rows in the matrix)
